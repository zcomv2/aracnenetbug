Aracne Net Bug [ANB-27] 🕷️💻 Aracne Net Bug is a cyberpunk-inspired, ethical information gathering and analysis bot. It uses search engines to extract relevant data, filters content based on keywords, and stores results for analysis. Designed to evolve into psychological countermeasures and strategic dismantling. 🚀

Aracne Net Bug [ANB-27] is a cyberattack tool designed to infiltrate and dismantle the networks of corrupt corporations and governments that exploit society and the planet's resources. Its code is darker and more lethal than the systems it combats, penetrating digital infrastructures with devastating precision. It does not target individuals, only entities that operate in the shadows with aims of domination and exploitation. Its advanced AI scans, identifies, and destroys critical control points, returning power to those who have been oppressed. Aracne Net Bug is the nightmare of the corrupt, a virus born from chaos to punish their own evil.


Phase 1: Information Gathering - Aracne Net Bug [ANB-27] 🕷️💻
The first phase of Aracne Net Bug [ANB-27] focuses on automated information gathering and analysis. This phase is designed to scan the web for relevant data, extract meaningful content, and store it for further processing. The system operates in the following structured steps:

Keyword-Based Web Search

The user inputs a set of keywords separated by commas.
The bot performs a search using DuckDuckGo, retrieving the top three most relevant results.
A menu displays the title, description, and URL of the search results.
User Selection & Web Scraping

The user selects one of the suggested results.
The bot accesses the selected URL and extracts its HTML content.
All unnecessary elements such as scripts, styles, and ads are removed.
Data Filtering & Extraction

The bot parses and cleans the text from the webpage.
It scans the content for matches with the input keywords.
Only relevant sentences are stored, removing duplicates and irrelevant text.
Storing & Processing Results

The extracted data is structured and saved into a JSON file (resultados.json).
The user can access this file to review the filtered information.
This initial phase establishes the foundation for future expansions, enabling data-driven intelligence and preparing the system for advanced functionalities such as pattern analysis, psychological countermeasures, and network infiltration strategies. 🚀
